# CS3339 Homework 2: Binary Representation, Floating-Point Math, and Bit Manipulation
## Isabella Liduario Buzelin Godinho - iwc13 - 03.28.2025

This repository contains one file with a program that automatically detects floating point overflow in C++ programs. 

### Building and running the code
Like most programs we have seen this semester, I recommend building the file on your preferred Texas State server (I used zeus and had no issues) using 'g++ -o fp_overflow_checker fp_overflow_checker.cpp'. To run it, simply type './fp_overflow_checker loop_bound loop_counter', substituting loop_bound and loop_counter for floating-point values. If you forget to include one or both values, the program will remind you about its proper usage.

### Known bugs
All known bugs have been corrected and nothing else was found after the last check.
